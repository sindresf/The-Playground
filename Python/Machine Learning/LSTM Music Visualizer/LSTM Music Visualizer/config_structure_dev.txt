NEED TO DEFINE MY STRUCTURE FOR HOW EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE PARSED

MAKETHE CONFIG FILE A JSON FILE?

AND THEN HAVE A HIGH LEVEL STRUCTURE SET?

REMEMBER TO TRY AND EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SETTINGS
 - LIKE VISUALIZATION SETTINGS DICTATING THE LSTM STRUCTURE
  - if the vizuals is black and white, then the input-output is just 2-to-2
  - got alpha it is at least 3-to-2
  - and so on

OH OH OH OH !!!!!! THE PARSER COULD BE PANDAS TO GET THE LSTMconfig.layers TYPE OF THING :D 

SOMETHING LIKE: (or yaml config file or what it was?)

{
	Visualizer_config: {
		pixel_amount: 10,
		screen_height: 800,
		screen_width: 1200,
		colorization: "B&W" #need some kind of "look for a more specialized color scheme" type of flag possible here   look below
	},

	LSTM_config: {
		layers: 2,
		layer_sizes: [50,40]
	},

	music_config: {
		music_file_path = "C:/here/file.music",
		something: "I guess"
	}
}

#for when "viridis" is not enough
{
	special_colors: {
		yes_please: "ok"
	}
}
