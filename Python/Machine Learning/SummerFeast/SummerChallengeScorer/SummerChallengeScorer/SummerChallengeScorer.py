#first time setup
#make ranges with a larger time step
#make stepwise sampling of expo-func
#fuck with it manually to create slight bump around "some timing"
#save in csv file for later runs

#Second time setup, or: how to train your LSTM
#train lstm on ranges and expo-func
#save lstm for direct questioning on other computers
#make automatic primer given alcohol level

#Third time setup
#have network trained
#prime it
#live plot second for second the output with bokeh
#have a pause or something to Mark the time actually taken through user input
# update is via while loop i think, so can interrupt there, or check for "marker input"
#keep the finalized plots for later revue by participants.
